/*Objective
In this challenge, you will work with arithmetic operators. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.

Task
Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer.

Example



A tip of 15% * 100 = 15, and the taxes are 8% * 100 = 8. Print the value  and return from the function.

Function Description
Complete the solve function in the editor below.

solve has the following parameters:

int meal_cost: the cost of food before tip and tax
int tip_percent: the tip percentage
int tax_percent: the tax percentage
Returns The function returns nothing. Print the calculated value, rounded to the nearest integer.

Note: Be sure to use precise values for your calculations, or you may end up with an incorrectly rounded result.

function solve(meal_cost, tip_percent, tax_percent) {
    // Write your code here
    const tip = meal_cost * (tip_percent/100)
    const tax = meal_cost * (tax_percent/100)
    const sum = Math.round(meal_cost + tip + tax)
    console.log(sum)
